"""List (and other) comprehensions are awesome!

All Python developers should familiarize themselves with
comprehensions and Python's built-in functions:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

Functional programmers will want to look at the itertools module,
which implements a number of familiar constructs:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes

However, many FP patterns can be written more clearly by taking
advantage of comprehensions.
